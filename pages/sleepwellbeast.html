                <p style="font-style: italic;">The band’s seventh album adds more chaos to their stately drama.
                    It is full of abandon and quiet contemplation as Matt Berninger sings not about how to enjoy life,
                    but how to simply endure it.</p>

                <p style="font-style: italic;">Sleep Well Beast is
                        what it is: an emotional battlefield, beautifully drawn, familiar and true.
                        Berninger voices a panicked, depressive insomniac who might be any of us, trying
                        to hold it together while everything falls apart. </p>

                <p style="font-style: italic;">Elegant melancholia isn’t enough for the National anymore.
                    On its seventh album, “Sleep Well Beast,” its new songs have more rhythmic ferment and melodic crosscurrents; 
                    they translate emotional complexity into musical counterpoint.</p>

                    yet more fresh nuance to that sound, as they seem to every time.

    <!--album description-->
    <section class="alb-desc container-fluid">
        <p class="album-description">Sleep Well Beast is their seventh album, and their first attempt at
                            inviting some of that disruptive energy into the studio. <br> Making records with this band
                            has sometimes sounded about as fun as a forced-bonding office retreat, but this time they
                            built a studio in a pastoral area of upstate New York that muted intraband creative
                            friction. <br> As Berninger memorably put it, “It’s hard to be a dick when you look out the
                            window and there’s this tranquil pond.” As a result, Sleep Well Beast quakes and shivers
                            with all kinds of un-National sounds—barbed, intentionally sloppy guitar attacks, drum
                            loops, bits of digital crunch and splatter, and a rawer, more abandoned performance from
                            Berninger. They don’t reinvent the band’s image so much as carefully muss its hair a bit,
                            unfasten one more button on its shirt collar. They are still a good dinner-party band, but
                            now they’ve made the album for when the wine starts spilling on the rug, the tablecloth is
                            rumpled, the music has imperceptibly gotten louder, and all those friendly conversations
                            have turned a little too heated. <br> <br>

                            The first single “The System Only Dreams in Total Darkness” was a bit of a shot across the
                            bow. The song introduces itself with a series of stray-hair noises—a steely guitar line, a
                            frosty choir of “oohing” voices, a boxy drum loop, and an imperious grand piano airlifted
                            from U2’s “New Year’s Day.” It forms an intriguing mist, but as you squint into it, familiar
                            shapes emerge: The major-key chorus arrives with the same effortlessness as all their best
                            songs, with that glinting phalanx of horns pushing it quietly forward. These are National
                            Songs, made with the sounds and feelings that should be poured into the making of a National
                            album. Some of the eccentricities and raw touches left at the edges feel like wind
                            resistance tacked onto a beveled-smooth vehicle after the fact. <br> <br>
                            But perhaps the most resonant lyrics here speak to the band’s persistence and the durability
                            of any long-term union. “Nothing I do/Makes me feel different,” he confesses on “I’ll Still
                            Destroy You.” <br> “Forget it/Nothing I change changes anything,” he offers on “Walk It
                            Back.” Like R.E.M., whose ongoing existence became its own kind of raison d’être as they
                            aged, the National offer testimony to something we don’t often celebrate: Enduring is a
                            superpower of its own. The fact that no one can talk about the National without invoking
                            their dependability might feel a bit unfair to them, or at least a bit tired. And yet,
                            there’s a reason it remains such a dominating lens through which to examine them.
                            Consistency is not boring. Consistency is a miracle, a small act of defiance against
                            entropy. Berninger has compared the band to a marriage, as all band members do, but their
                            music feels particularly devoted to the quotidian nature of lifelong unions, the way that
                            your success is measured in time, how each year together turns your commitment into its own
                            kind of monument. There’s a reason anniversary cards say things like “All these years later,
                            I still love you.” It’s because the miracle isn’t in the “love,” it’s in the “still.”
